\Chabstract{本模板按照山东农业大学信息学院毕业设计(参考版)设计，由于\LaTeX 和Word存在一些差别，所以无法做到百分之百的一样，但是，本人在编写过程中已经尽量使得格式符合学院的要求，由于不清楚是否符合学院的要求，需要老师鉴定或者认可之后才能使用进行论文的撰写。需要注意的是，由于模板中需要有华文行楷和方正小标宋简体的字体，如果用户没有该字体需要进行下载，同时学院要求要有word，不推荐\LaTeX 转word，容易识别错误或者其他致命的错误。}

\Enabstract{This template is designed according to the graduation design (Reference Version) of School of information of Shandong Agricultural University There are some differences with word, so it can't be 100\% the same. However, in the process of writing, I have tried to make the format meet the requirements of the college. Because I don't know whether it meets the requirements of the college, I need the teacher's appraisal or approval before I can write the thesis. It should be noted that because the template needs to have the font of Chinese line regular script and founder small mark song simplified Chinese, if the user does not have the font, they need to download it. At the same time, the college requires word, and it is not recommended to convert the word from latex, which is easy to identify.}	%英文摘要
